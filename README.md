## Description 

I used Bootstrap CSS Framwork to create a mobile responsive portfolio with the following items: navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images. 

> Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

### Minimum Requirements Met for a Responsive Portfolio
- [x] Functional, deployed application
- [x] GitHub repository with README describing the project
- [x] Navbar consistent on each page.
- [x] Navbar on each page contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
- [x] All links work.
- [x] Uses semantic html.
- [x] Each page has valid and correct HTML. (I used a [validation service](https://validator.w3.org/))
- [x] Contains my personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
- [x] Utilizes Bootstrap components and grid system.
### Bonus
- [x] Portfolio site uses sticky footer, sub-rows and sub-columns.
